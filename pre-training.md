------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Day 2 (May 24, 2023): Introduction to Mplus and MplusAutomation in R

Learning Outcomes:

1.  Using Mplus software, fellows will learn the basic skeleton of an Mplus input (*.inp*) syntax, run basic descriptive statistics, and evaluate output (*.out*)

2.  Using the `MplusAutomation` package, fellows will will be able to run descriptive statistics in R.

3.  This workshop will cover the creation of R-projects and R markdowns and discuss the benefits of organization of the R workflow.

4.  Fellows will have the opportunity to learn how to enhance and customize their R markdowns by applying themes to their documents

Synchronous Activity:

-   [Introduction to MplusAutomation](https://github.com/immerse-ucsb/intro-to-mplusautomation)

Asynchronous Activity:

-   Complete Part 3 of "Introduction to MplusAutomation": Descriptive Statistics
-   [How to make your R markdown pretty!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v048ru5v0BE&ab_channel=JosiahParry)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Day 3 (May 26, 2023): Data wrangling, exploration and visualization

Learning Outcomes:

1.  Fellows will be able to describe principles and challenges of reproducible data science.
2.  Fellows will be able to explain tidy data principles and recognize when those principles might not apply, depending on the needs of an analysis method.
3.  Using R in RStudio, Fellows will be able to wrangle data with categorical variables, encode continuous variables to categorical, and transform data frames from wide to long format and back.

Preparation:

-   Work through the [Intro to R and R Studio tutorial](https://immerse-ucsb.github.io/intro_to_rstudio.pdf) if not already done, including installing R and R Studio.
-   Read ["Why don't we share data and code? Perceived barriers and benefits to public archiving practices" (Gomes et al. 2022)](<https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JwVBErmizy4A660cMGUsaJEc5AVr5aUE/view?usp=share_link>) and reflect on your coding and sharing practices and challenges, in preparation for a brief discussion in the synchronous session.

Synchronous Activity:

-   Discussion of benefits and challenges of coding, reproducible research, and collaboration
-   Live coding: data wrangling with categorical data
    -   [Set up RStudio workspace in global options](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xnIJ8maW_yHn-vYFba6AhULMMLplIGjJQuIM2iqmpDw/edit#heading=h.k5zbnx9cqbgj)

Asynchronous Activity:

-   [Homework, day 3](https://docs.google.com/document/d/114q-eMuRIaFi4eN0dyRF6v0HiES7VFZVGvNn8E8jNMA/edit#)
-   [Additional data wrangling: self-guided tour](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11EJTE3XNZjB3deuwLeFf2c65c08cZ_Dg/view?usp=share_link): Download the zip, follow directions in part two of the homework document.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Day 4 (May 31, 2023): Collaborative, reproducible workflows with R, RStudio, git and GitHub

Learning Outcomes:

1.  Using Git and GitHub, Fellows will be able to fork an existing repository, and clone it to an R project using RStudio.
2.  Using R in RStudio, Fellows will be able to use simple loops and functions to automate and iterate coding tasks.
3.  Using R in RStudio, Fellows will be able to use the `stringr` package and simple regular expressions to wrangle text data.

Preparation:

-   [Sign up for a GitHub account, and set up Git on your computer](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Yc47HH0OiQUs0DR9rz4xoUYCtyCy6ddf9vye8BIN2Oc/edit?usp=share_link)
-   [Link RStudio and Github, and set up a personal access token PAT](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1pDv-hoeJxxYFbvp6vX2ZvTgxDIAYGfj8UTSYIkLS0Zs/edit)
-   Read ["Better Science in Less Time" (Lowndes et al. 2017)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1b-6r919k35kDPnc4iyNzdcnVtNz0yEwE/view?usp=share_link). Table 1 provides a good overview of tools available to improve open data science.

Synchronous Activity:

-   [Live coding: loops and functions; text wrangling](https://github.com/oharac/immerse_day4_iter_and_fxns). We will also practice with GitHub!
-   Continue discussion on benefits and challenges of reproducible, collaborative, open data science.

Asynchronous Activity:

-   [Additional text wrangling: self-guided tour](https://github.com/oharac/text_workshop): Fork then clone this repository to your computer. Code along with the .HTML files in numeric order, or run line by line through the .Rmd scripts, as you prefer. Note, some of `1_stringr_tutorial` will be duplicated in the Day 4 live coding session, but this script contains additional details and more complex wrangling cases.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Day 5 (June 2, 2023): Data science principles: data organization, storage, sharing, and code

Learning Outcomes:

1.  Fellows will be able to create GitHub repositories on GitHub and in R/RStudio.
2.  Fellows will be able to work with others to collaborate on a coding script; they will learn strategies to safely collaborate (to avoid merge conflicts), and will learn how to resolve a merge conflict if (when!) one does occur.
3.  Fellows will explore additional collaboration and communication tools using R/RStudio and Git/Github.

Preparation:

-   Read ["Not just for programmers: How GitHub can accelerate collaborative and reproducible research in ecology and evolution" (Braga et al 2023)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tpgS-bI16bP0dddkdbilCmFL_4Oxezgc/view?usp=share_link). Before reading, look at Fig. 2 - it nicely organizes many of the ways GitHub can facilitate collaboration, ordered by technical difficulty. As you read, choose three or four of those skills/activities that interest you most, and prepare to discuss those during the synchronous session.

Synchronous Activity:

-   Practice with GitHub and RStudio to create repositories
-   Working in pairs, practice techniques to safely collaborate on a script, then create and resolve a merge conflict
-   Work with git in the Terminal/command line
-   Discuss features of GitHub to effectively collaborate and communicate your science

Asynchronous Activity:

-   GitHub Pages - build a website using R/RStudio and GitHub!
    -   Personal site (Distill or Quarto)
    -   Course site (from template)
