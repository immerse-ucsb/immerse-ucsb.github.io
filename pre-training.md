### Day 4 (May 31, 2023): Collaborative, reproducible workflows with R, RStudio, git and GitHub

Learning Outcomes:

2.  Using R in RStudio, Fellows will be able to use simple loops and functions to automate and iterate coding tasks.
3.  Using R in RStudio, Fellows will be able to use the `stringr` package and simple regular expressions to wrangle text data.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Day 5 (June 2, 2023): Data science principles: data organization, storage, sharing, and code

Learning Outcomes:

1.  Fellows will be able to create GitHub repositories on GitHub and in R/RStudio.

3.  Fellows will explore additional collaboration and communication tools using R/RStudio and Git/Github.

Preparation:

-   Read ["Not just for programmers: How GitHub can accelerate collaborative and reproducible research in ecology and evolution" (Braga et al 2023)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tpgS-bI16bP0dddkdbilCmFL_4Oxezgc/view?usp=share_link). Before reading, look at Fig. 2 - it nicely organizes many of the ways GitHub can facilitate collaboration, ordered by technical difficulty. As you read, choose three or four of those skills/activities that interest you most, and prepare to discuss those during the synchronous session.

Synchronous Activity:

-   Practice with GitHub and RStudio to create project repositories
-   Working in pairs, practice techniques to safely collaborate on a script, then create and resolve a merge conflict
-   Work with git in the Terminal/command line
-   Discuss features of GitHub to effectively collaborate and communicate your science

Asynchronous Activity:

-   GitHub Pages - build a website using R/RStudio and GitHub!
    -   Personal site (Distill or Quarto)
    -   Course site (from template)
