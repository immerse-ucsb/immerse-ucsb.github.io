### Day 1 (May 7, 2024): Introductions, training goals, introduction to data science


Learning Outcomes:

1. Fellows will be able to create a first draft of their equity-focused research goals that can be addressed with mixture modeling in the upcoming year.

2. Fellows will be able to identify how the IMMERSE training goals and opportunities can help them to apply mixture modeling training their research goals
